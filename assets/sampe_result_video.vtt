Okay, children,
everyone pick an instrument.

00:00:11.322 --> 00:00:12.455
Doesn't matter which one.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.556
Everyone's gonna be bad.

00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.759
Eh, who cares? I'm union.

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:19.896
I told you,
I am not playing an instrument.

00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:22.198
You're playing an instrument.

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:24.500
Mom, music is made by computers,

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:28.204
not rusty metal you put
in your... ugh... mouth.

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.207
Look, your mom thinks
that forcing you to do music

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:33.409
in school will somehow make you
into a different person

00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:36.078
than we all know you are...
which it won't... so just do it,

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:38.047
or I'll cut all your shorts into skirts.

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:39.248
Fine.

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:41.250
What about this stupid thing?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.074

Why don't you try this clarinet?

00:00:52.063 --> 00:00:54.697
It's like the recorder, but cooler.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.739
What about this hobo guitar?

00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:12.748
At least he was wearing a tuxedo.

00:01:12.784 --> 00:01:14.383
Now can we get out of here?

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:16.485
The Wi-Fi sucks,
and I'm trying to click through

00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:19.322
this slideshow of celebrities
who let themselves go.

00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:22.325
Word is that number four is insane.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.227
And here's the form which says

00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:26.262
you're responsible for the instrument.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.602
So, if I break the violin,
Homer has to pay?

00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:34.570
Homer has to pay?

00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:36.639
The school is lending
your son an instrument

00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:39.041
that's worth $430.

00:01:42.947 --> 00:01:48.117
Violin, you and me are gonna
make beautiful music together.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.144
Bart? Bart?

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.546
$430 violin?

00:02:20.351 --> 00:02:23.753
If the beer's in a frosted mug,
you're not an alcoholic,

00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:25.988
you're an aficionado.

00:02:26.024 --> 00:02:28.291
Hello, Father.

00:02:28.326 --> 00:02:30.226
Thank you for taking responsibility

00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:32.395
for this lovely instrument.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.330
I trust you find its music...

00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:36.933
soothing.

00:02:36.968 --> 00:02:38.968
Come on, dude, just leave me alone.

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.804
I'm a good man. I've got kids!

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.673
You're right, I've been too hard on you.

00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:45.474
Here you go. Catch.

00:02:56.955 --> 00:02:59.922
You. You. I took you into my home,

00:02:59.958 --> 00:03:01.791
and you've stolen everything from me.

00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:03.426
You know what this is?

00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:06.295
It's me playing
the world's smallest violin.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.570
I'm free. I'm free.

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:16.205
I'm finally free!

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:20.576
Mwah!

00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:22.411
Where are you going?

00:03:22.447 --> 00:03:27.116
To do to my brain what I just
did to your dreams for our son.

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:30.720
<i>Chug, chug, chug!</i>

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:32.722
Chug, chug, chug!

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:40.396
The little engine that could...
get me wasted.

00:03:40.431 --> 00:03:43.165
Yeah, everyone loves
the ol' Disorient Express.

00:03:45.136 --> 00:03:46.802
Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking.

00:03:46.838 --> 00:03:49.105
What? You have the nerve to call me?

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.240
Why don't you delete my number
from your phone,

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:52.875
then put the phone in a sock,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.477
and then beat yourself in the head

00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:58.147
till your face looks like
motor lodge buffet eggs!

00:03:58.182 --> 00:04:00.149
Yeah, another prank call, huh?

00:04:00.184 --> 00:04:02.985
Who was it this time, uh,
"Anita Manbone"?

00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:04.453
"Ivan Talickya"?

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.188
Ooh, ooh, I got one.

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:08.290
"John Rootbeer."

00:04:09.827 --> 00:04:11.127
Eh, it wasn't no prankster.

00:04:11.162 --> 00:04:13.262
It was someone I know all too well.

00:04:13.297 --> 00:04:15.631
- Oh, who?
- Shut your stinkin' face-hole!

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.867
That's who it was, okay?! Bar's closed!

00:04:17.902 --> 00:04:20.236
Everybody get out! Get out!

00:04:26.144 --> 00:04:29.111
Oh, stupid drunk breath.

00:04:29.147 --> 00:04:30.379
Ah.

00:04:32.316 --> 00:04:33.883
Oh, stupid drunk dog!

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:40.423
Guess I'll have to order
a ride on my smartphone.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.026
Get in.

00:04:45.663 --> 00:04:48.364
No mints? I should've just called Uber.

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:51.634
Hey. What's with Moe?

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.302
It's too late for the cockfights

00:04:53.337 --> 00:04:55.037
and too early for the rat fights.

00:04:55.073 --> 00:04:57.740
He's been extra psycho
since he got that phone call.

00:04:57.775 --> 00:05:01.177
I just want to...

00:05:01.212 --> 00:05:03.546
Oh, it sounds like that time
you lit the barbecue

00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:05.014
with a possum inside.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.150
Hmm, maybe we should follow him.

00:05:08.186 --> 00:05:09.785
Mm, you're the sober one.

00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:13.089
Call me, will you?
Oh, I'll meet you, all right.

00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:14.690
I'll meet you good.

00:05:27.238 --> 00:05:28.737
I'll kill you.

00:05:28.773 --> 00:05:30.106
I'll kill you, you dirty mug!

00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:31.907
You've got to stop them.

00:05:34.445 --> 00:05:35.945
Let me go, huh?

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.513
I'm one loafer smack away

00:05:37.548 --> 00:05:39.482
from tearing off his whole hair system!

00:05:39.517 --> 00:05:42.017
Why are you fighting with an old man?

00:05:42.053 --> 00:05:44.753
Because this old man...

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.589
is my old man.

00:05:46.624 --> 00:05:49.125
Morty Szyslak. Nice to meet you.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.360
You mean nothing to me. Huh?

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:54.697
All you are is a rotten old
rib roast covered in cologne.

00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:56.465
You ungrateful punk.

00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:59.368
You're not worthy to walk
through a cloud of my scent.

00:05:59.403 --> 00:06:01.036
I never should've called you.

00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:03.005
On that we agree.

00:06:04.442 --> 00:06:09.178
The saddest thing in the world
is seeing a family broken apart.

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:13.482
Drunk dog.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.103
Oh, I ain't seen my pops for years.

00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:23.706
After he called,
I weakened and went to meet him.

00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:25.941
But one sniff of "Eau de Sportcoat,"

00:06:25.977 --> 00:06:28.277
and my shoe was in my hand.

00:06:28.312 --> 00:06:31.847
How could you go so long
without seeing your own father?

00:06:31.882 --> 00:06:34.783
Seriously, how'd you do it?
It sounds amazing.

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:36.218
Yeah, well, let me explain.

00:06:36.254 --> 00:06:39.054
You know how the world
sees me as a... a...

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.123
- Human toilet brush?
- Bingo.

00:06:41.158 --> 00:06:43.759
Well, I'm the white sheep of my family.

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:46.295
They're involved
in a very evil business.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.530
- Illegal drugs?
- No, worse.

00:06:48.566 --> 00:06:51.634
- Prescription drugs?
- Oh, well, not that bad.

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.337
The Szyslaks are... mattress salesmen.

00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.406
Eh, I know, I know.

00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:59.975
They're like mortgage brokers
without the moral code.

00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:01.977
Charging people 1,200 bucks

00:07:02.013 --> 00:07:04.413
for what's essentially a big bag of hay.

00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:13.989
Growing up, it was me, my dad
and my brother and sister.

00:07:14.025 --> 00:07:16.058
We were the biggest
mattress chain in town,

00:07:16.093 --> 00:07:19.061
mainly thanks to our local TV ads.

00:07:19.096 --> 00:07:21.096
How does it...?

00:07:21.132 --> 00:07:22.298
There it is.

00:07:25.102 --> 00:07:27.069
Here ye, hear ye!

00:07:27.104 --> 00:07:30.072
I declare the best deals
in all the land!

00:07:30.107 --> 00:07:32.775
And don't ye forget: no credit...

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.543
No problem!

00:07:34.578 --> 00:07:36.278
So come on down to Mattress King,

00:07:36.314 --> 00:07:38.981
at any one of our many
convenient locations.

00:07:40.484 --> 00:07:42.685
We'll have you sleeping
on a new mattress

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.787
- to...
- Knight!

00:07:44.822 --> 00:07:47.056
- And cut.
- Great work, kids.

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:49.058
Everyone gets an onion.

00:07:51.062 --> 00:07:53.796
<i>But there was another
reason for our success,</i>

00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:55.397
<i>as I was about to learn.</i>

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:58.701
Son, your voice is finally
gravelly enough

00:07:58.736 --> 00:08:02.538
for you to learn what it takes
to survive in the sleep biz.

00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:04.206
Bedbugs?!

00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:06.642
These are Hungarian mattress gnashers.

00:08:06.677 --> 00:08:08.544
The only way to get rid of them

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:11.613
is to walk away from your house
naked and start a new life.

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:17.619
Y-You're gonna sabotage our rivals?

00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:20.122
No, no, no, no, no, no. You are.

00:08:20.157 --> 00:08:23.659
You want to be a sandman,
a slumber jack, a yawn jockey?

00:08:23.694 --> 00:08:27.262
This is what it takes.
It's the Szyslak way.

00:08:39.877 --> 00:08:42.010
<i>They were the competition, sure,</i>

00:08:42.046 --> 00:08:43.746
<i>but they were a family, too.</i>

00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:46.148
<i>I couldn't ruin them.</i>

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:51.153
You should be proud.
You did a good deed.

00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:54.823
Yeah, well, that good deed
ruin't my life.

00:08:54.859 --> 00:08:57.292
<i>That family I took pity on,</i>

00:08:57.328 --> 00:09:00.095
<i>they doused our mattresses with bedbugs.</i>

00:09:00.131 --> 00:09:02.865
<i>The Szyslak empire was ruin't.</i>

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.100
<i>Soon, we were down
to just a few locations.</i>

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:07.703
<i>My pops never said
how disappointed he was,</i>

00:09:07.738 --> 00:09:09.738
<i>but he let me know in his own way,</i>

00:09:09.774 --> 00:09:11.740
<i>by kicking me out and turning my room</i>

00:09:11.776 --> 00:09:14.543
<i>into a home gym he never used.</i>

00:09:14.578 --> 00:09:17.179
My brother and sister took
my place in my father's heart.

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:20.482
The only connection I had
with Pops was LinkedIn.

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:22.484
That's worse than nothing.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.620
Why do you think your dad
reached around to you

00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:26.288
after all these years?

00:09:26.323 --> 00:09:28.857
I don't care. I don't care so much!

00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:30.726
Moe, you will never have peace

00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:32.828
until you make up with your father.

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:34.930
Honey, I need you to hear this:

00:09:34.965 --> 00:09:39.234
sticking your nose in Moe's
horrible life will end badly.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.904
Homer, what's your favorite movie?

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:43.405
Fast & Furious 6.

00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:45.340
And what's the theme of that movie?

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:46.742
Cars.

00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:48.377
What's the other theme?

00:09:48.412 --> 00:09:50.512
Family.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.014
She's right, Moe.

00:09:52.049 --> 00:09:54.750
You got to give your cars
a second chance.

00:09:58.055 --> 00:09:59.573
Is that your family's mattress store?

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.924
- No.
- Is that your family's mattress store?

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:03.425
- No.
- Is that your family's mattress store?

00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:04.560
No!

00:10:04.595 --> 00:10:05.894
Geez, I never noticed

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.863
how many mattress stores there are.

00:10:07.898 --> 00:10:10.332
Yeah, you never do
till you're shopping for one.

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:12.401
Then they're freakin' everywhere.

00:10:14.638 --> 00:10:17.773
That mattress looked perfectly
fine when it was delivered.

00:10:17.808 --> 00:10:20.709
It's not my fault you flipped it over!

00:10:20.744 --> 00:10:22.711
Mr. Szyslak, I've brought someone here

00:10:22.746 --> 00:10:25.080
who still cares for you.

00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:27.216
Um, hey there, Pops.

00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:31.253
I'm, uh, I'm sorry about
shoe-slapping your face and all.

00:10:31.288 --> 00:10:34.022
Well, maybe I had it coming.

00:10:34.058 --> 00:10:35.624
You hittin' that?

00:10:35.659 --> 00:10:38.927
- Can I, uh, say I am?
- Mm-mm.

00:10:40.664 --> 00:10:43.131
That must be Moe's brother and sister.

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:46.768
They don't look ugly like Moe,
but I'm still feeling the ugly.

00:10:46.804 --> 00:10:50.539
Ugh. That one's eating
Chinese food with scissors.

00:10:54.144 --> 00:10:56.111
Hey, what's Ugly Do-Right doing here?

00:10:56.146 --> 00:10:57.913
He ain't no mattress man.

00:10:57.948 --> 00:11:01.884
I will never forgive you for
what you made Dad did to you.

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:04.953
Oh, so we're doing the "what
I done made Dad did" thing?

00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:06.989
Because I can did this all day long!

00:11:07.024 --> 00:11:08.624
Shut up, you box springs!

00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:12.327
I'm the one what reached around
to this cesspool of disappointment.

00:11:12.363 --> 00:11:15.867
- You know, to make amends.
- Amends?!

00:11:15.892 --> 00:11:17.499
- Amends?!
- Amends?!

00:11:17.535 --> 00:11:20.536
There's no reason
for this to come to shoes!

00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:23.005
I want you all to come to our house

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.840
for a family forgiveness dinner.

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:26.275
We'll be there.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.076
Can I bring a bottle of something?

00:11:28.112 --> 00:11:29.745
That would be lovely.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.014
You want oxy or Demerol?

00:11:32.049 --> 00:11:33.315
<i>Okay, the brother here,</i>

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.317
the father there, Moe here...

00:11:35.352 --> 00:11:36.919
No. No good.

00:11:36.954 --> 00:11:38.921
You know, when this all ends horribly,

00:11:38.956 --> 00:11:41.924
it's gonna be pretty hard
not to say "I told you so."

00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:43.358
Just don't say it.

00:11:43.394 --> 00:11:45.460
You've never been married,
have you, Lisa?

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.195
When you love someone very much,

00:11:47.231 --> 00:11:50.032
the toughest thing
is not to rub their face

00:11:50.067 --> 00:11:52.868
in their horrible screw-ups.

00:11:57.174 --> 00:12:00.642
So, okay, here's a fun game.

00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.878
Everyone take turns
saying something nice

00:12:02.913 --> 00:12:05.380
about a person they're related to.

00:12:05.416 --> 00:12:08.684
I'll start. Lisa has lovely penmanship.

00:12:08.719 --> 00:12:10.819
Thank you, Mom.

00:12:10.854 --> 00:12:13.755
Me? Uh, well, it's...

00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:17.793
admirable how my stupid father
reached around to this traitor!

00:12:17.828 --> 00:12:19.795
I'm impressed that you better shut up

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.663
and make nice with the traitor!

00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:26.301
I like that Bart...

00:12:26.337 --> 00:12:30.572
uh... Bart is... he, uh...

00:12:30.608 --> 00:12:33.352
- Can I do two Lisas?
- Dinner fight!

00:12:33.377 --> 00:12:35.410
Yeah, whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Huh?

00:12:36.447 --> 00:12:38.347
Homer! Go to phase two.

00:12:40.084 --> 00:12:43.719
<i>'Twas the sale before Christmas,
and all through the store!</i>

00:12:43.754 --> 00:12:48.090
<i>All the deals were amazing
on twin sets and more!</i>

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:51.560
<i>Mattress night</i>

00:12:51.595 --> 00:12:55.030
<i>Low, low price</i>

00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:58.800
<i>No payments due, but... ♪</i>

00:12:58.836 --> 00:13:00.902
Am I the only one feeling all oniony

00:13:00.938 --> 00:13:02.904
about the way things used to be?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.107
We were dressed as stinkin' reindeer,

00:13:05.142 --> 00:13:07.342
but we were really a stinkin' family.

00:13:07.378 --> 00:13:09.611
Oh, I miss you frigs.

00:13:09.647 --> 00:13:11.947
Aw...

00:13:11.982 --> 00:13:14.683
Marge, thank you for
reaching around to my family.

00:13:14.718 --> 00:13:17.519
I got something to tell all of youse.

00:13:17.554 --> 00:13:20.455
I'm retiring.

00:13:20.491 --> 00:13:23.892
Sleepy is the head
that wears the mattress crown.

00:13:23.927 --> 00:13:26.928
That's right, my springs have sprung.

00:13:26.964 --> 00:13:29.631
To my son, I give a store.

00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:32.901
- To my daughter, I give a store.
- Aw.

00:13:32.936 --> 00:13:34.636
Well, good dinner, everyone.

00:13:34.672 --> 00:13:37.406
I'll see youse at the funeral
of whoever dies first.

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:40.075
And to my oldest son, I give a store.

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:44.246
Wha...? I buried this dream so deep,

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:47.683
no amount of self-harm
could ever carve it out.

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:51.753
Aw.

00:13:53.991 --> 00:13:56.992
Oh, the smell of foam off-gassing.

00:13:57.027 --> 00:14:00.362
When I cross this threshold,
I begin a new life!

00:14:01.699 --> 00:14:03.331
This is the first time

00:14:03.367 --> 00:14:05.834
that I've ever been carried
into a store.

00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:08.336
Look at me now, Lady Foot Locker!

00:14:08.372 --> 00:14:09.871
Look at me now.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.730
Hey, everyone.
Hey, thanks for coming out.

00:14:15.765 --> 00:14:17.832
Uh, if anybody wants a glass of wine,

00:14:17.867 --> 00:14:19.767
they're on the memory foam.

00:14:19.802 --> 00:14:23.004
Oh! Hot dang. My goodness.

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:25.306
Okay, okay, all right,
shut your, shut your faces.

00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:28.743
Uh, the commercial that me and
my brother and sister all made

00:14:28.778 --> 00:14:30.778
is about to air now.

00:14:30.813 --> 00:14:32.513
<i>I cannot tell a lie.</i>

00:14:32.548 --> 00:14:35.116
<i>It's good to be back
in the mattress biz.</i>

00:14:35.151 --> 00:14:37.985
<i>Sleep softly and carry a big discount!</i>

00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:40.588
<i>And now we're freeing the savings!</i>

00:14:40.623 --> 00:14:44.291
<i>So rush-more to Mattress King
Slumber Super Stores,</i>

00:14:44.327 --> 00:14:48.062
<i>as we all welcome our big
brother Moe back to the family!</i>

00:14:48.965 --> 00:14:49.997
<i>And remember,</i>

00:14:50.033 --> 00:14:51.432
<i>at Moe's location,</i>

00:14:51.467 --> 00:14:54.669
<i>every mattress had someone die on it.</i>

00:14:56.172 --> 00:14:59.240
Dead-o's on my mattresses?

00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:01.676
Hey, hey, somebody messed
with our commercial.

00:15:01.711 --> 00:15:04.011
<i>Who died on Moe's mattresses?</i>

00:15:04.047 --> 00:15:06.013
<i>Shut-ins. Fat people.</i>

00:15:06.049 --> 00:15:09.183
<i>And inmates! Inmates! Inmates!</i>

00:15:09.218 --> 00:15:10.885
No, no, it's all lies! Come back!

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.520
My mattresses are brand-new!

00:15:12.555 --> 00:15:14.522
Made in the finest Filipino sweatshops

00:15:14.557 --> 00:15:16.857
by the cutest kids you ever saw!

00:15:16.893 --> 00:15:18.959
That's a gross a-mattress!

00:15:18.995 --> 00:15:22.363
They betrayed me.
Stabbed me right in the hump.

00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:23.964
Sorry, big brother.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.934
We saw an opportunity to knock
you out of the family business,

00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:28.335
and we took it.

00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:30.004
It's the Szyslak way.

00:15:32.041 --> 00:15:34.308
But I-I brought them together.

00:15:34.343 --> 00:15:36.310
How could things end so badly?

00:15:36.345 --> 00:15:38.179
<i>Don't say "I told you so."</i>

00:15:38.214 --> 00:15:39.680
<i>Don't say "I told you so."
Don't say "I told you so."</i>

00:15:39.716 --> 00:15:41.982
Maybe I shouldn't have gotten involved.

00:15:42.018 --> 00:15:44.318
<i>Don't say "I told you so."
Don't say "I told you so."</i>

00:15:44.353 --> 00:15:45.986
Why didn't somebody warn me?

00:15:46.022 --> 00:15:47.822
<i>Don't say "I told you so."</i>

00:15:47.857 --> 00:15:50.291
I told...

00:15:58.735 --> 00:16:01.535
When my pop finds out
I got played for a chump, huh,

00:16:01.571 --> 00:16:04.705
he'll wish he never reached
around to me in the first place.

00:16:04.741 --> 00:16:06.674
Moe, I'm so sorry.

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:09.009
For the first time,
I'm going to offer you

00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:10.945
platonic physical comfort.

00:16:14.317 --> 00:16:16.617
I just can't go through with it.

00:16:16.652 --> 00:16:19.153
Aw, it's all right.
You got closer than most.

00:16:19.188 --> 00:16:21.822
But I have to believe it's not too late

00:16:21.858 --> 00:16:24.892
to reach around and fix things
with your family.

00:16:24.927 --> 00:16:27.828
No, no, no.
I tried things the Marge way.

00:16:27.864 --> 00:16:31.098
Now I'm gonna do this the Szyslak way.

00:16:31.134 --> 00:16:32.867
No. No!

00:16:32.902 --> 00:16:35.102
That's right, me and my family,

00:16:35.138 --> 00:16:37.605
we're going to the mattresses, baby!

00:16:39.342 --> 00:16:41.509
I better go with him.

00:16:41.544 --> 00:16:43.744
To make sure I see it.

00:17:15.645 --> 00:17:17.611
Oh, my God. What happened?

00:17:17.647 --> 00:17:19.947
We cut 'em up good.

00:17:19.982 --> 00:17:22.416
They ain't so pretty no more!

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:23.472
_

00:17:23.497 --> 00:17:27.421
All this was just revenge appetizers!

00:17:27.456 --> 00:17:29.924
Tonight is the main course.

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:32.359
And I'm serving it up family style.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.730
There's only one man who can stop this.

00:17:39.135 --> 00:17:42.102
Sir, this shirt depicts
an octopus sportfishing

00:17:42.138 --> 00:17:43.938
and drinking a mai tai.

00:17:43.973 --> 00:17:47.441
It's the bestseller in our
Retired Blowhard collection.

00:17:47.476 --> 00:17:48.742
Oh, yeah.

00:17:48.778 --> 00:17:51.812
I can see myself watching golf in this.

00:17:51.848 --> 00:17:54.481
Mr. Szyslak Sr.,
you've got to do something!

00:17:54.517 --> 00:17:57.284
Your children are
tearing each other apart!

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.486
No, no. I'm retired now.

00:17:59.522 --> 00:18:01.822
Let them work out
their own little tiffs.

00:18:01.858 --> 00:18:04.091
Does this look like a tiff?

00:18:04.116 --> 00:18:06.216
_

00:18:06.262 --> 00:18:07.895
Free mattresses?!

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.564
The time for leisure wear is over.

00:18:13.436 --> 00:18:15.402
Mahalo, sir.

00:18:15.438 --> 00:18:18.239
Moe's in there, and I've never
seen him this angry before,

00:18:18.274 --> 00:18:21.675
not even when he lost
that angriest man contest.

00:18:21.711 --> 00:18:23.677
He's crazy! He's gonna do it!

00:18:23.713 --> 00:18:25.713
He's really gonna do it!

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:29.083
I'm up here, Pops.

00:18:29.118 --> 00:18:31.552
I'm playing with
my little brother and sister.

00:18:31.587 --> 00:18:33.254
Just like old times.

00:18:38.294 --> 00:18:40.394
Hungarian mattress gnashers!

00:18:40.429 --> 00:18:45.266
If he releases those bugs,
all our mattresses are ruined!

00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:50.104
Not mine. My mattresses
are safe and sound.

00:18:52.308 --> 00:18:54.708
All my enemies... gnashed!

00:18:54.744 --> 00:18:57.011
It's the Szyslak way!

00:18:57.046 --> 00:18:59.513
Morty! Do something!

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.087
Do it! Smash that jar!

00:19:07.123 --> 00:19:09.523
Take what's rightfully yours!

00:19:09.558 --> 00:19:12.192
- Wait, what?
- You wanted him to dooze this?

00:19:12.228 --> 00:19:14.628
He's finally man enough
to finish the job,

00:19:14.664 --> 00:19:17.097
just like he should've
all those years ago.

00:19:17.133 --> 00:19:18.599
Do it, son!

00:19:18.634 --> 00:19:20.567
Everything will be yours!

00:19:20.603 --> 00:19:22.870
Do it for your king!

00:19:22.905 --> 00:19:25.606
Do it for your king.

00:19:43.359 --> 00:19:45.626
I can't do it.

00:19:45.661 --> 00:19:47.061
Wha...?!

00:19:47.096 --> 00:19:48.395
Sorry, Pops.

00:19:48.431 --> 00:19:51.198
I guess I'll never live the Szyslak way.

00:19:52.468 --> 00:19:55.336
Oh, Moe, you're a good man.

00:19:55.371 --> 00:19:58.806
And these soulless mattress
jackals don't deserve you.

00:19:58.841 --> 00:20:00.808
I never thought I'd say this,

00:20:00.843 --> 00:20:04.545
but some families
just don't belong together.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:07.047
Yeah, yeah, I'll kill ya!

00:20:08.684 --> 00:20:11.018
Ph-Physical contact.

00:20:12.993 --> 00:20:15.580
_

00:20:27.803 --> 00:20:31.205
I told you so!

00:20:42.745 --> 00:20:44.945
Hey, this is Moe S.
from the Mattress King.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.681
Give me a call at 555-0146.

00:20:47.716 --> 00:20:49.449
For a limited time only,

00:20:49.485 --> 00:20:52.753
the Mattress King's got
queen mattress sets for $99

00:20:52.788 --> 00:20:55.222
and king sets for $129.

00:20:57.126 --> 00:20:58.959
Ooh! Are you okay?

00:20:58.994 --> 00:21:02.029
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

00:21:02.064 --> 00:21:03.864
That's what I was afraid was gonna...

00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:05.532
that's what I was
afraid was gonna happen

00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:07.434
- with that damn thing.
- You all right?

00:21:07.469 --> 00:21:08.935
- Oh, I'm fine.
- You sure?

00:21:08.971 --> 00:21:10.937
Messed up my guitar, though.
No, I'm fine.

00:21:10.973 --> 00:21:12.439
- You sure you're, uh...
- No, I'm fine.

00:21:12.474 --> 00:21:13.774
Try your arm and stuff.

00:21:13.809 --> 00:21:15.475
- He's wearing leather.
- Oh, okay.

00:21:15.511 --> 00:21:17.344
- Did you get it on film?
- Yeah.

00:21:17.379 --> 00:21:19.312
All right. All right!

00:21:19.337 --> 00:21:24.337
