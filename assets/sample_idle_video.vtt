Can't let you do it.

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:05.452
Can't let you break my record.

LENNY, CARL AND BARNEY: 27... 28...

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:19.473
Okay, Homer, this is
the last pickled egg.

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.483
Keep it down and you win 50 bucks.

00:00:21.518 --> 00:00:24.719
Okay. If I win, we're
going out for omelets.

00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:31.793
Yeah! I am the champion
of this very bad idea.

00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:33.461
Uh-oh.

00:00:33.497 --> 00:00:34.896
He's gonna blow.

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:41.236
Hey, Moe, you're not gonna
serve those eggs, are you?

00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:44.906
No, no. I, uh, I find
another use for them.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.481
_

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:53.848
Hmm.

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:57.285
I was 50 bucks up until I blew
every egg out of my belly.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:59.955
Oh!

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.090
Whoa! Hey, there, pal.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:05.994
I'm afraid that was the
mayor's favorite light pole.

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:07.996
You give me the car,

00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:11.900
I give you 500 bucks and I
make all of this go away.

00:01:11.935 --> 00:01:15.203
Uh, this is awkward.

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:17.105
You don't have to thank me.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.473
Ugh!

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.076
Marge.

00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:22.911
When you start a sentence with "Marge,"

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:24.212
it's really bad.

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:26.881
Marge, Marge, Marge.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:29.851
I sold our car.

00:01:29.886 --> 00:01:32.387
- What are you gonna drive?
- Your car.

00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:35.190
Oh. Well, then I guess
I'll be riding the bus.

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:38.893
That's right. Like rock
stars and Rosa Parks.

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.130
Now just wait till you see
what's become of our car.

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:45.066
Feast your eyes on this.

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.316
_

00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.884
Why are you showing me this?

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:04.052
I don't get it.

00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:06.454
And I'm crying.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.256
Lousy wrong channel.

00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:09.692
_

00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:12.260
The Legends of Demolition
Derby-Derby-Derby

00:02:12.295 --> 00:02:15.096
are coming to Springfield-
Springfield-Springfield!

00:02:15.132 --> 00:02:16.664
So shut up!

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.099
And get your ass-ass-ass

00:02:18.135 --> 00:02:21.002
over-over-over here-here-here!

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:22.337
Proceeds go

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:23.972
to stuttering-stuttering-stuttering.

00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.541
Wait for it. Wait for it.

00:02:30.313 --> 00:02:33.248
We've got all the
Demolition Derby greats!

00:02:33.283 --> 00:02:35.150
Vince "Dead Tooth" McGee!

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:37.185
James "Psychiatric Disorder" Porter.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.420
"Meth" MacFarland.

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:40.455
Mysterious Fandango

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.091
and a very drunk Billy Joel.

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:45.994
I'm sorry, but most of these
names mean nothing to me.

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:47.662
Here it comes!

00:02:47.697 --> 00:02:49.931
And making his triumphant return

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:53.301
to the Crash Zone after a
full skull transplant,

00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:55.670
Gene "No Helmet" Dupree!

00:02:55.705 --> 00:02:59.307
Eh? My car in a demolition derby!

00:02:59.342 --> 00:03:01.843
And we got primo tickets
for Saturday night.

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:03.645
Look at them fan.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.946
Wait, wait, wait.

00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:07.182
This is the point where
Lisa always ruins it.

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:08.316
No, I'm good with it.

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.484
People get out their aggression

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.786
and destroy carbon-burning cars.

00:03:11.822 --> 00:03:13.121
See? Ruined it.

00:03:13.156 --> 00:03:14.656
And then I noticed

00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:18.126
there wasn't any more cinnamon
on top of my rice pudding.

00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.328
And I said, "Where's the cinnamon?"

00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:23.398
And they said, "There never
was any cinnamon, Abe."

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.200
Fine, Dad, we'll get you some cinnamon!

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:27.001
I can't tolerate cinnamon!

00:03:27.037 --> 00:03:29.671
So, I started asking
everyone in the TV room

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:31.072
if they remembered the cinnamon

00:03:31.108 --> 00:03:33.141
and the answer will surprise you.

00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:34.876
The results were incon...

00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:36.911
When did you get that put in?

00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:38.913
Worth every penny.

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.683
But how many pennies is that?

00:03:41.718 --> 00:03:43.718
Homer Simpson, you can't just...

00:03:55.232 --> 00:03:56.498
Hmm.

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:58.166
All right, young'uns.

00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:00.835
You know that movie Cars that you likes?

00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:02.170
Uh-huh.

00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:04.172
Well, all your favorite characters

00:04:04.207 --> 00:04:06.875
is gonna commit suicide here today.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.109
- Huh?
- What?

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.780
_

00:04:11.781 --> 00:04:13.548
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:16.551
please silence all cell phones

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:19.954
and holster all truck nuts.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.758
And now, in conformance with the
latest paleontological theories

00:04:23.793 --> 00:04:28.863
about dinosaurs, please welcome
the all-new Truckasaurus Two.

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:33.635
I love you, Steven Spielberg.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.537
Now, a brief moment in memory

00:04:35.572 --> 00:04:39.207
of those we lost in the past week.

00:04:51.788 --> 00:04:53.154
And now...

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.256
let the bash-'em-ups begin!

00:04:57.928 --> 00:05:00.161
If I get hit by a brain, can I keep it?

00:05:00.197 --> 00:05:02.230
Be sure to get it signed afterwards.

00:05:02.265 --> 00:05:03.431
There's our car!

00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:08.636
Wow. Without Dad's weight
in it, it really moves.

00:05:15.412 --> 00:05:17.078
Oh, my God, this is it.

00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:19.681
Only one car stands in our way.

00:05:19.716 --> 00:05:21.583
It's down to Homer's Boner

00:05:21.618 --> 00:05:26.287
and Car-rak Obama, the
Affordable Healthcare Mobile,

00:05:26.323 --> 00:05:29.123
which you can't kill no
matter how hard you try.

00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:37.699
My whole life has been
leading to this one moment.

00:05:40.003 --> 00:05:42.170
Oh! My chest hurts!

00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:43.338
That's called pride.

00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:45.740
My arm is numb!

00:05:45.775 --> 00:05:46.874
Numb with pride.

00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:50.612
Son, I need to go to the hospital.

00:05:50.647 --> 00:05:52.680
Huh?

00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:54.582
Sure, Dad.

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:13.868
I missed it.

00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:15.970
Can you see the pain you're causing him?

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:18.306
Go on, git!

00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:21.643
I'm sorry to say it,
uh, doesn't look good.

00:06:21.678 --> 00:06:26.314
Homer, your father would like
to see you, uh, one last time.

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.250
I hope you've got a return
receipt on that balloon.

00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:32.487
I always do.

00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:36.324
Homer, there's something
I need to tell you.

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:40.328
I'll give you two a moment
in this, uh, semiprivate room.

00:06:40.363 --> 00:06:42.497
Where is the nurse with my...

00:06:42.532 --> 00:06:46.901
Son, I did a terrible
thing many years ago

00:06:46.936 --> 00:06:50.672
and I need you to forgive me before...

00:06:50.707 --> 00:06:53.174
before it's too late.

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:56.277
Anything, Dad.

00:06:57.914 --> 00:06:59.213
Uh-huh.

00:07:00.717 --> 00:07:02.050
Uh-huh.

00:07:03.753 --> 00:07:05.620
You already said that part.

00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:08.189
Remember, you can't tell anyone.

00:07:08.224 --> 00:07:09.390
It's awful!

00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:11.559
I swear. Now get to the point.

00:07:14.998 --> 00:07:16.397
You didn't!

00:07:17.934 --> 00:07:19.400
Okay.

00:07:19.436 --> 00:07:20.968
I forgive you.

00:07:21.004 --> 00:07:24.505
Your conscience is the one
clean thing in this room.

00:07:27.644 --> 00:07:30.645
Well, we tried everything we could...

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.113
and the last thing worked.

00:07:32.148 --> 00:07:34.449
How did you save him?

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:36.250
When a body is in too much pain,

00:07:36.286 --> 00:07:39.420
the brain releases a hormone
to bring a merciful death.

00:07:39.456 --> 00:07:42.623
But an expensive new drug
blocks that and keeps him alive.

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:44.492
What a glorious day!

00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:46.294
I'm gonna live

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:50.398
and my son has forgiven me
for the worst thing I ever did.

00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:52.967
Yes. Forgiven.

00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:58.973
Sir, you just destroyed
a box of hospital cotton balls.

00:07:59.008 --> 00:08:00.808
- That's $75,000.
- D'oh!

00:08:02.022 --> 00:08:05.347
Now I want to watch
my favorite new show,

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:07.816
currently in its 17th season.

00:08:27.838 --> 00:08:31.840
It looks like another murder
at Jackson Island Naval Base.

00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:33.742
That's what makes America great.

00:08:33.777 --> 00:08:36.511
Prompt investigation of
in-house naval crimes.

00:08:36.547 --> 00:08:38.547
Homie, look who's here.

00:08:38.582 --> 00:08:39.915
Yeah, I see.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.017
Oh, Homer, are you a Sunday puzzle?

00:08:42.052 --> 00:08:44.686
'Cause you sure seem down and a'cross.

00:08:44.722 --> 00:08:47.522
My dad did something to
me I can never forgive.

00:08:47.558 --> 00:08:49.491
No worse than what God did to his son

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:50.926
and they wrote a book together.

00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:52.461
Bye.

00:08:52.496 --> 00:08:55.831
He tricked me with his code
blue and his flatlining.

00:08:55.866 --> 00:08:57.699
And I fell for it like a sap.

00:08:57.735 --> 00:08:58.934
What did he do?

00:08:58.969 --> 00:09:01.336
I promised him not to
say what he told me,

00:09:01.372 --> 00:09:04.539
but I will never look at
him the same way again.

00:09:04.575 --> 00:09:07.743
Yeah, but you forgave me, so
that means you have to love me.

00:09:07.778 --> 00:09:09.411
Nyeah, nyeah, nyeah, nyeah, nyeah.

00:09:09.446 --> 00:09:11.046
Marjorie, I'm sorry,

00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:13.949
but I do not want to be in
the same room with this man.

00:09:13.984 --> 00:09:15.217
I'm going to Moe's.

00:09:15.252 --> 00:09:16.718
Then I'm going to Moe's!

00:09:16.754 --> 00:09:19.254
Then I'm staying here.

00:09:21.225 --> 00:09:22.891
A gun and a sailor hat.

00:09:22.926 --> 00:09:25.127
Nothing screams naval
crime more than that.

00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:29.765
I'm going to Moe's.

00:09:30.567 --> 00:09:32.734
I hate seeing a father and a son

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.536
sit at opposite ends of the bar

00:09:34.571 --> 00:09:36.405
'cause it means I got to walk more.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.107
Now come on, youse guys.
Bury the ol' hatchet.

00:09:40.778 --> 00:09:42.210
Hey, life is short.

00:09:42.246 --> 00:09:44.112
You could be killed by a drunk driver,

00:09:44.148 --> 00:09:46.948
die of cirrhosis,
stabbed in a bar fight.

00:09:46.984 --> 00:09:49.918
All kinds of random bad things
happen to my customers.

00:09:49.953 --> 00:09:51.653
All right, look, here's 50 cents, huh?

00:09:51.688 --> 00:09:53.889
Play the jukebox and the love tester.

00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:06.067
You heard Ray Charles.

00:10:06.103 --> 00:10:09.070
Actually, in my jukebox, we
can't afford no Ray Charles.

00:10:09.106 --> 00:10:11.173
It's a white guy named, uh, Charles Ray.

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:13.508
Excellent vision, excellent vision.

00:10:13.544 --> 00:10:16.945
Dad, Grampa, the place we're
going is the perfect way

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.747
to make you guys friends again.

00:10:18.782 --> 00:10:20.816
I went there for Janey's
last birthday party.

00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:22.617
You think you can solve our problems

00:10:22.653 --> 00:10:24.586
at a kids' birthday party place?

00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:27.522
It's cheaper than therapy
and it comes with cake.

00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:31.426
If cake solved problems, Homer
would have a Nobel Peace Prize.

00:10:31.462 --> 00:10:33.261
That's a bullcrap prize.

00:10:33.297 --> 00:10:34.796
They gave it to Kissinger.

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:37.233
_

00:10:37.234 --> 00:10:39.367
Welcome to the Escape Zone.

00:10:39.403 --> 00:10:43.038
The latest attempt to get
people to save a dying mall.

00:10:43.073 --> 00:10:45.607
Now, would you like to be buried alive?
_

00:10:45.642 --> 00:10:46.808
Done it for real.

00:10:46.844 --> 00:10:48.877
How about Medieval Dungeon?

00:10:48.912 --> 00:10:51.947
Got to be less torture
than listening to him. Hey.

00:10:51.982 --> 00:10:53.148
Thank you.

00:10:53.183 --> 00:10:55.817
Okay, you two are trapped in a dungeon.

00:10:55.853 --> 00:10:59.254
The only way out is to solve
ten puzzles by working together.

00:10:59.289 --> 00:11:00.355
Yeah, whatever.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.357
Super!

00:11:02.392 --> 00:11:04.125
They're just sitting there.

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:06.394
I bet they'd hurry if they
knew we had balloons.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.896
They're moving.
_

00:11:07.931 --> 00:11:12.133
Son, if you take this sword and
stick it in that magic portal,

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:15.370
I think it might open
a bookcase somewhere.

00:11:15.405 --> 00:11:18.540
Yes, that makes perfect
sense. I'll just...

00:11:23.847 --> 00:11:27.182
Homer? You're not getting out
to say good-bye to your dad?

00:11:27.217 --> 00:11:29.251
He's probably afraid we'll see how much

00:11:29.286 --> 00:11:31.253
the car lifts when he gets out.

00:11:31.288 --> 00:11:34.222
No, I'm not.

00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:36.658
There's only one way to
make you guys understand.

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:39.261
I'll tell you what Grampa told me.

00:11:39.296 --> 00:11:41.596
That was in confidence.

00:11:41.632 --> 00:11:45.200
And in this family, we keep
our promises. Starting now.

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:47.235
I am telling.

00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:50.505
Oh, God. Oh, God. I hate conflict.

00:11:52.376 --> 00:11:55.410
- Then just leave your body.
- Okay.

00:11:55.445 --> 00:11:56.645
Hey!

00:11:59.716 --> 00:12:02.050
When I was growing up,
my dad loved to make

00:12:02.085 --> 00:12:04.119
model World War II airplanes.

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:07.222
Watch it, son. You're
gonna break the wing.

00:12:07.257 --> 00:12:09.691
Oh, now you got glue up your nose.

00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:12.627
Oh! Don't eat the decal.
How many have you had?

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.964
Just leave me be.

00:12:19.336 --> 00:12:20.569
Oh!

00:12:20.604 --> 00:12:23.371
I work hard all week at
the model plane factory,

00:12:23.407 --> 00:12:25.407
and this hobby is my one escape.

00:12:25.442 --> 00:12:28.109
Can you please watch
this little monster?

00:12:28.145 --> 00:12:29.744
When he gave me to her,

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.746
it was the best thing he could've done.

00:12:31.782 --> 00:12:33.748
- This is the dough.
- Dough.

00:12:33.784 --> 00:12:38.453
Yes, dough. Now, I need someone
very strong to roll this out.

00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:47.030
_

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.382
Love you.

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:41.850
She loved me.
_

00:13:41.885 --> 00:13:44.819
And for each pie she made,
she wrote down the recipe

00:13:44.855 --> 00:13:47.522
and put a special note
to me on the back.

00:13:47.557 --> 00:13:49.858
We don't know what life will bring,

00:13:49.893 --> 00:13:53.061
so on your birthday or
any day you need it,

00:13:53.096 --> 00:13:55.563
you'll know that your mother loved you

00:13:55.599 --> 00:13:58.366
and have reasons to love yourself.

00:13:58.402 --> 00:14:02.137
You just taught me food is love.

00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:05.073
I like myself.

00:14:05.108 --> 00:14:06.808
That lunch box

00:14:06.843 --> 00:14:09.224
was the most valuable
possession I ever had.

00:14:10.447 --> 00:14:12.714
When she left,

00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:15.216
those recipes were all
I had left of her.

00:14:15.252 --> 00:14:17.185
And that's the end. What a sweet story.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.254
And there's some things
that shouldn't be gone into

00:14:19.289 --> 00:14:22.057
until a man is dead and can't be kicked.

00:14:22.092 --> 00:14:23.992
After she ran away,
my father was furious

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:26.027
and did something terrible.

00:14:27.964 --> 00:14:29.864
He threw my recipes off a cliff.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.867
Everything that reminded him of her.

00:14:39.276 --> 00:14:40.675
He lied to me.

00:14:40.711 --> 00:14:44.245
He told me she took the recipes
with her when she left.

00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:45.880
Are you sure, Daddy?

00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:48.583
Yes. And don't ask me again
till I'm on my deathbed.

00:14:49.986 --> 00:14:53.788
Wait. Why are you looking like that?

00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:56.057
If this man had had those notes,

00:14:56.093 --> 00:14:58.193
his life would've been different.

00:14:58.228 --> 00:14:59.694
He would've had confidence.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.763
He would've had his mother with him!

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:03.565
I would've had hair!

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.767
Homie, that's not very realistic.

00:15:05.802 --> 00:15:08.057
And I would've been more realistic.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.164
- Grampa, so thoughtless.
- Mean old man.

00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:14.322
His slippers don't even
have bottoms anymore.

00:15:14.358 --> 00:15:18.293
I never thought I'd say this
word, but here it comes: coot.

00:15:18.328 --> 00:15:20.529
Homer, why are you smiling?

00:15:20.564 --> 00:15:24.888
We're finally hating
together as a family.

00:15:26.036 --> 00:15:28.970
What do you say we all go
to that home and yell at Grampa?

00:15:29.006 --> 00:15:31.073
Oh, that would be lovely.

00:15:31.108 --> 00:15:33.642
Now enjoy this sweet song of hate.

00:15:33.677 --> 00:15:37.746
♪ If I could save hate in a bottle ♪

00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:41.149
♪ The first thing that I'd like to do ♪

00:15:41.185 --> 00:15:43.718

00:16:03.273 --> 00:16:06.708
- Lousy Grampa.
- So heartless.

00:16:06.743 --> 00:16:09.044
Always calls me "buddy" or "fella."

00:16:09.079 --> 00:16:11.413
Don't forget he's hard of hearing.

00:16:11.448 --> 00:16:13.248
Lousy Grampa!

00:16:13.283 --> 00:16:15.016
So heartless!

00:16:15.052 --> 00:16:17.385
What you did was crap, Grampa!

00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:20.722
- I want to yell at him first.
- I want to yell at him first.

00:16:20.757 --> 00:16:23.525
Hey, has anyone considered
the silent treatment?

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.393
The silent treatment doesn't work.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.430
It doesn't work.

00:16:28.465 --> 00:16:31.032
It does not work.

00:16:31.068 --> 00:16:33.235
Okay, fine, it works.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.804
It works so well.

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:38.807
Please say something.

00:16:40.744 --> 00:16:42.744
How long has it been? Three months?

00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:45.247
I don't even remember
a time before this.

00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:49.584
Where's Grampa?

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:53.488
- He hasn't touched his lunch.
- Or his lunch meds.

00:16:53.524 --> 00:16:57.926
"My beloved family..." Oh, boy.

00:16:57.961 --> 00:17:00.262
"I've learned an important lesson,

00:17:00.297 --> 00:17:02.831
never get things off your chest.

00:17:02.866 --> 00:17:05.400
Which reminds me of a gal
named Chesty Lazar.

00:17:05.435 --> 00:17:09.571
She ran a speakeasy on Hawaii
right before Pearl Harbor.

00:17:09.606 --> 00:17:11.306
Pearl Harbor was the name of the lady

00:17:11.341 --> 00:17:12.974
who bought the joint..."

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.777
Digression... digression...

00:17:15.812 --> 00:17:18.480
Crazy talk... Ah, here's the end.

00:17:18.515 --> 00:17:19.781
The point is,

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:22.651
confessing don't really
make you feel better,

00:17:22.686 --> 00:17:25.520
'cause it don't redo
the bad thing you did.

00:17:25.556 --> 00:17:29.839
So I'm gonna undo what I done
if it's the last thing I do.

00:17:30.227 --> 00:17:32.494
Hmm. Mm.
_

00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:36.531
Oh, no. He's heading for that
cliff to look for those recipes.

00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:38.133
I'm gonna find him, save him,

00:17:38.168 --> 00:17:41.836
and tell him I can't wait till he dies.

00:17:42.873 --> 00:17:45.006
Leave me alone. I'm gonna find it.

00:17:45.042 --> 00:17:48.009
Don't do it, Dad! Most is forgiven!

00:17:50.914 --> 00:17:53.548
Wait, what's your rope tied to?

00:17:57.554 --> 00:17:58.620
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

00:18:00.357 --> 00:18:01.556
Oh, my God.

00:18:04.328 --> 00:18:06.528
Please be okay. Please be okay.

00:18:08.398 --> 00:18:10.198
Oh...

00:18:10.234 --> 00:18:11.299
Hmm?

00:18:19.276 --> 00:18:20.742
Don't worry, son.

00:18:20.777 --> 00:18:23.245
This will give you all
the rope you need.

00:18:24.748 --> 00:18:28.350
Dad, no! I love you. Mom
left, but you were there.

00:18:28.385 --> 00:18:30.719
Cranky, a little drunk,
sometimes not there,

00:18:30.754 --> 00:18:32.554
but you were always there.

00:18:32.589 --> 00:18:35.190
Oh. You love me.

00:18:35.225 --> 00:18:37.158
That's all I need to hear.

00:18:42.899 --> 00:18:45.667
Good thing I also threw out
your mother's bed when she left.

00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:50.105
I can still smell her perfume.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.107
And I've got the recipes back.

00:18:53.877 --> 00:18:55.043
Huh?

00:18:55.078 --> 00:18:59.347
Oh. They're gone, just like Mom.

00:18:59.383 --> 00:19:02.384
- I'm sorry, son.
- It's okay, Dad.

00:19:02.419 --> 00:19:04.519
Life doesn't always
give you neat endings

00:19:04.554 --> 00:19:06.388
that tie everything up in a bow.

00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:08.224
_

00:19:08.225 --> 00:19:12.761
Mmm. This pie is fantastic.

00:19:12.796 --> 00:19:16.197
It's what I imagine eating
great jazz would be like.

00:19:16.233 --> 00:19:18.033
Always with the jazz.

00:19:18.068 --> 00:19:21.636
It tastes exactly like
my mom used to make.

00:19:21.672 --> 00:19:23.872
Exactly!

00:19:23.907 --> 00:19:26.941
Excuse me, how the hell
did you get this recipe?

00:19:26.977 --> 00:19:28.943
It was a miracle, actually.

00:19:28.979 --> 00:19:32.314
33 years ago, this place
wasn't doing well,

00:19:32.349 --> 00:19:35.283
possibly due to our
location under a cliff.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:37.752
I went out to contemplate my fate...

00:19:37.788 --> 00:19:41.489
when suddenly, like a gift
from God, the recipes came.

00:19:48.498 --> 00:19:50.098
I'd never seen such recipes,

00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:52.167
such brilliant fruit combinations

00:19:52.202 --> 00:19:54.502
and such beautiful messages on the back.

00:19:58.442 --> 00:20:00.975
Those messages were for me.

00:20:01.011 --> 00:20:04.245
Well, then you should have them.

00:20:04.281 --> 00:20:07.816
Everything tied up in a bow.

00:20:13.023 --> 00:20:15.457

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:42.973
